is_incremental() macro

is_incremental() is a flag that identifies the execution mode; false if we are in 
Full Refresh mode and true in Incremental Mode. This macro is used within your modelâ€™s 
.sql definition. The most common use case is to add a filter to the where clause to 
limit the quantity of data pulled from the upstream models.
